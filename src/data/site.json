He then served an LDS mission in Viña del Mar, Chile where he learned to speak Spanish. In 2007, Mr. Baron graduated cum laude from the J. Reuben Clark School of Law at Brigham Young University, where he was Executive Editor of the Journal of Public Law and Associate Editor of the Education Law Journal. After law school, Mr. Baron became a civil litigator in Park City where he defended multi-million dollar construction companies and real estate developers in commercial litigation. Looking to develop more experience in trial, he left civil litigation for the Salt Lake City Prosecutor's Office in 2008 where he handled over 1500 criminal cases per year, including over thirty jury trials.",
